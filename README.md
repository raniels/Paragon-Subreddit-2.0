# Forking the Repository

## Forking
Simply click the fork button at the top right of the repository to copy this repository into your own to make changes to.

# Cloning your Repository

## Requirements
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (I recommend the command line NOT GUI)

## Installing
When installing, for ease of use I recommend leaving the shell integration on.

# Cloning

In any folder, open up Git bash and type 'git clone -b (branch) (insert your git url here) (folder)'. For example `git clone -b fortnite https://github.com/DoctorJew/Paragon-Subreddit-2.0.git fortnite-repo'

This will clone the remote repository into a folder called fortnite-repo.

This is not a git tutorial so for more information on how to push changes, look online (git add, git commit, git push)

# Compiling the SASS

## Requirements 
* [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

## Installing Dependencies
Open Command Prompt or Powershell in the cloned repository and simply run 'npm install'. All dependencies should be automatically installed.

## Compiling to CSS
Open Command Prompt or Powershell in the cloned repository and simply run 'gulp'. All .scss files will be compiled to the /css directory.
